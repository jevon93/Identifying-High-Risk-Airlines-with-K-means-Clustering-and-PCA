# K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis in R

This repository includes an R script file which uses the in-built R package fivethirtyeight to demonstrate K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis on airline fatalities and crash data.

The file KmeansAirline R walks through the data cleaning, clustering, PCA and modelling process as well as provides interpretation of results within the comments. K-means is a simple but efficient method in identifying clusters in un-labelled numeric data and principal component analysis is useful for dimensionality reduction by identifying and aggregating correlated features into "prinipal components" and effectively explaining the variance in the data with correlation matrices between variables.
